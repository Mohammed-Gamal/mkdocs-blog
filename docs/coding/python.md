# Using Python for beginners

## Introduction

This notebook is an example of how to use Python for beginners. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for various applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.

## Getting Started

To get started with Python, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. Once you have Python installed, you can start writing and running Python code using an interactive interpreter or a code editor.

## Writing Your First Python Program

Let's write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Open a text editor and create a new file called `hello.py`. Add the following code to the file:

=== "Python"

    ``` python title="main.py" linenums="1"
      # Print "Hello, World!" to the console
      print("Hello, World!") 
    ```

=== "C++"

    ``` c++ title="main.cpp" linenums="1"
      #include <iostream>

      int main(void) {
        std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
        return 0;
      }
    ```

Save the file and run it using the Python interpreter. You should see the output "Hello, World!" printed to the console.

???+ tip "Trick in Python"

    ``` python title="main.py" linenums="1"
      # Print "Hello, World!" to the console
      text = "Hello, World!"
      print(text) 
    ```
    For more information you can check the official Mkdocs documentation at [Mkdocs Docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/).

## Variables and Data Types

Python supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more. You can create variables to store data of different types and perform operations on them. Here's an example of creating variables and working with different data types:

```python title="main.py" linenums="1"
# Create variables of different data types
num1 = 10
num2 = 3.14
name = "Alice"
is_student = True
```

| Data Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| int | Integer | `10` |
| float | Floating-point number | `3.14` |
| str | String | `"Alice"` |
| bool | Boolean | `True` |

You can use variables[^1] to store data, perform calculations[^2], and manipulate strings in Python.
[^1]: Variables are used to store data in memory and can be assigned different values during the execution of a program.
[^2]: Calculations are performed via the CPU, specifically the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), which is responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations.

## Control Structures

Python supports various control structures, including if-else statements, loops, and functions. You can use these control structures to control the flow of your program and perform different actions based on conditions. Here's an example of using if-else statements and loops in Python:

```python title="main.py" linenums="1"
# Example of if-else statement
num = 10
if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")
else:
    print("Negative number")

# Example of a for loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

You can use control structures to make your Python programs more dynamic and interactive.

???+ Success "Tasks to Try"
    - [x] **Task 1:** Create a Python program that checks if a number is even or odd.
    - [x] **Task 2:** Implement a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number.
    - [x] **Task 3:** Write a Python program that generates a Fibonacci sequence.
    - [x] **Task 4:** Create a Python program that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order.

## Conclusion

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that is easy to learn and use. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, Python offers a wide range of features and libraries to help you build applications, analyze data, and solve complex problems. By learning Python, you can unlock a world of possibilities and take your programming skills to the next level.

If you're new to Python, I encourage you to explore the language further and experiment with different features and libraries. Python has a vibrant community and extensive documentation that can help you learn and grow as a programmer. Happy coding! üêçüöÄ
